==================================================
(MY) BEST PRACTICE
==================================================
This text file contains some rules I follow when
I code. I cannot force everyone to do it my way,
but I'd like to clarify my coding style and keep
the code of this project mostly in the same style.

Of corse, there are some standard rules like:
 - Clean your source.
 - Format your source correctly, but be sure
    to not cause a lot of differences between your
    local file and the repo file. It necessary,
    format your source manually.
 - Name variables appropriately.
 - Comment your code.
 - Write function descriptions so they can be
    read without opening the functions source
    itself.
 - ... etc.

1. Short Conditionals (IF)
--------------------------------------------------
    if (x == y) return true;

I often do something like this, because I like the
slim notation without the '{' and '}'.
If the condition is longer or more complex, I use
a line break after the conditional.

    if (x == y)
        return true;

The same rule applies, when the conditional has an
'else if' or 'else' sequence.

    if (x == y) return true;
    else return false;

or

    if (x == y)
        return true;
    else
        return false;

Very important: I do not mix these versions with
each other. Something like the following is not
my style:

    if (x == y) return true;
    else
        return false;

2. Inline Conditionals
--------------------------------------------------
If there is a short conditional for assigning a
variable or returning a value, I write it the
following:

    x = (y > 20) ? true : false;
